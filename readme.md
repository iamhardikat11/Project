## Implementation

In contrast to a typical [TodoMVC](https://todomvc.com) app, this app does not
utilize a frontend JavaScript framework or make use of client-side capabilities
such as `localStorage`.  Instead, it illustrates how to build a todo app using
a backend for application logic and persistence, along with HTML forms for
interaction.

This app is built using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) along with the [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/)
web framework.  Data is persisted to a [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/)
database.  HTML pages are rendered using [EJS](https://ejs.co/) templates, and
are styled using vanilla CSS.  HTML forms are used to modify data, rather than a
RESTful API.  That being said, the forms serialize data in a format inspired by
[Todo-Backend](https://todobackend.com/).

To run this app, clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jaredhanson/todos-fastify-sqlite.git
$ cd todos-fastify-sqlite
$ npm install
```

Then start the server:

```
$ node server.js
```

Navigate to [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000).
